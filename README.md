<br>

MioCrew is an app designed to help people coordinate group trips. Users can create trips, add the crew who's going, create a schedule, track expenses, and more.

The front-end is built using Next.js and React.js. Cypress, Storybook, Material UI, and Tailwind CSS are also used.

The back-end will be built using Python, FastAPI, and a SQL database.

### Update log:

7/22/25: Frontend is almost complete, with only the login and settings pages missing, along with some final cleanup. Backend still not implemented.

7/9/25: Frontend is almost complete, with only the login and expenses pages missing. As there is no backend, some of the current data is shared between trips.
